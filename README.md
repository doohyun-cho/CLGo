This is an official repository of CLGo: Learning to Predict 3D Lane Shape and Camera Pose  from a Single Image via Geometry Constraints

An earlier version of CLGo can be found at [3DLSCPTR](https://github.com/liuruijin17/3DLSCPTR)

I am in home isolation due to the COVID19 exploration in Xi'an, so codes and models might come later. Thank you for your interest and patience!
